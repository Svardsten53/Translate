# 🌍 BirdNET-Pi Customization & Translation

Ever since I started using **BirdNET-Pi** several years ago, I have adapted the appearance to my own wishes.  
Among other things, I think it is nice to have the different pages in **my own language**.  
I have shared my adaptation with others in Sweden.  

Now I have developed the whole thing further so that only a **single command** is required to do everything that is needed.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Translation into another language**  
  Applied on all pages that are open and do not require login.

- 🏷️ **Custom page title**  
  Insert the installation location name and your national flag.

- ☁️ **Flexible header space**  
  Add local weather or other custom information.

- 📚 **Wikipedia links**  
  Automatically redirected to your own language version.

- 🔄 **One-click updates**  
  A single command is entered the first time, then a button under *System Controls* handles updates.

- ⚡ **Fast installation**  
  Update process takes only **30–45 seconds**.

## 🔧 How it works

- The entire installation is downloaded with each update (`git pull -f`) and then **modified from scratch**  
  *(except for `index.php` and your own custom files)*

- A **Translate** folder is downloaded locally, including all files, commands, etc.  
  You can make changes and run locally if necessary.  
  If used, the main program with updates is still downloaded, but the customization routine itself is not overwritten.

## 🤝 Community Translations

- Translation into other languages is generated with **AI**.  
- Some manual corrections may be needed.  
- Volunteers from each country are welcome to improve and refine the translations.

🚀 With this approach, anyone can quickly set up BirdNET-Pi in **their own language** with custom local information.
