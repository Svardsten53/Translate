Here are files for translation from English to other languages ​​in BirdNET-Pi. The translations are made with the help of AI, which means that they probably need to be corrected in some places. I would be very grateful if someone from each country could go through the files and correct what is needed.

Either create a fork of my repository and send a Pull Request or cut and paste the content and add the corrected text to an Issue.

As soon as a correction for a language has been received, I will supplement that country with anything else that is needed for the modification to be able to run. For Sweden, everything is ready and can therefore be used.

Thanks for your help!
